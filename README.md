# LymanBreakActivity
This code is a recreation of the code created by Samuel Wait for his Honour's thesis: Traversing the Cosmic Timeline: Exploring Distant Galaxies with the Lyman Break Technique (2023).

This repo aims to condense Sam's code into a main Jupyter notebook, that can read alongside Sam's thesis. This code is intended to be used as an exercise to learn and understand packages used in Sam's work.

It is intended that through doing this code I will gain the skills that can be used in my own thesis.
